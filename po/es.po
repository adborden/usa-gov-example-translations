"h3>Trust</h3><h4>Trust is reciprocal</h4><p>Trust was a theme that figured into "
"most of our conversations. Agencies tend to focus on building public trust in go"
"vernment, but we found that the public views trust as a two-way street: Not only"
" does the public need to trust the government, but the government needs to trust"
" the public.</p><h4>Lack of reciprocal trust</h4><p>Many people feel that govern"
"ment employees and agencies assume they have negative intentions or that they’re"
" lying, lazy, or a criminal. One person reported feeling like they were guilty u"
"ntil proven innocent.</p><p>Consider the experience of one of our interviewees. "
"Velma A., a resident of Jacksonville, applied for Social Security disability ben"
"efits twice. Her first application was denied, and so she applied again. She exp"
"ressed concern that her second application would also be denied &mdash;&nbsp;she"
" admitted that she hadn’t fully understood how to answer all of the questions on"
" the application, but she also felt she couldn’t leave any fields blank. “Leavin"
"g blanks is like you not really telling the whole story,” she said, “so I filled"
" it in best I could.” She knew her description of her disability wouldn’t be as "
"accurate as that written by a medical professional, and she worried the person r"
"eviewing her application would think she was lazy instead of legitimately disabl"
"ed. The stress of wondering how her application would be perceived compounded Ve"
"lma’s already stressful situation.</p><p>How an agency physically represents its"
"elf also plays a huge role in building trust. Jim F.,&nbsp;a senior citizen in M"
"inneapolis, said that visiting a local agency office \"feels like you're visitin"
"g someone in prison.\" He was put off by the security measures, including the me"
"tal detectors, the glass pane between separating him from the government employe"
"e, and the metal tray used to send documents back and forth.</p><p>These two sto"
"ries illustrate the government’s presumed lack of trust in the public. If the go"
"vernment were to more explicitly communicate its assumption of the public's need"
"s and positive intent (and design services around both), it could drastically im"
"prove public perception.</p><h4>Deciding to trust government services</h4><p>Our"
" interviewees employed a variety of strategies before deciding to trust a govern"
"ment service.</p><p>Many people mentioned that they look for one or more of the "
"following to evaluate the trustworthiness of a digital service:</p><ul><li>https"
"</li><li>.gov domains</li><li>Official government logos</li><li>Trust-building l"
"anguage such as “this is an official government website”</li></ul><p>One of our "
"interviewees, for example, mentioned that he always looks for the .gov URL and a"
"ssumes a site is OK if he sees that. “As far as I know,” he said, \"government w"
"ebsites can't be spoofed yet.\"</p><p>Other people need more than just the .gov "
"to trust a site. Karen S. of Kansas City relies on several different clues to as"
"sess a government site’s trustworthiness. She told us that she looks at the logo"
"s a site uses to determine its validity, and she also looks for an affiliation t"
"o departments or agencies she’s aware of. Finally, she said, she bases her trust"
" on whether a site “looks legit.”</p><p>Velma A. expressed a sentiment common to"
" several of our interviewees. She feels it’s hard to rely on a fixed set of trai"
"ts to determine a service’s trustworthiness. This uncertainty, she said, “ [is] "
"why a lot of older people, like my parents are older, don’t trust the internet f"
"or nothing.”</p><p>People also look for certain trust signifiers in non-digital "
"transactions. Velma A. also mentioned that when she calls a government phone num"
"ber, she specifically listens for language like, “Thank you for calling the U.S."
" department of&hellip;”</p><h4>Government agencies versus private companies</h4>"
"<p>Other folks aren’t able to differentiate government services from private com"
"panies. A man in Minneapolis with three sons told a story about how he paid a fe"
"e to fill out the FAFSA for one of his sons. He said, “You have to take the FAFS"
"A test so, I’ll be a little critical, you pay money to be told you don’t qualify"
". Why don’t they tell you right upfront. If your income is above x, don’t bother"
" paying the fee just to be told you don’t qualify. I found that to be very frust"
"rating and my wife, in the second year, says you need to do that again because y"
"ou must not have filled it out right. I said I can’t not fill it out right. It’s"
" pretty simple. So I filled it out again, paid the fee &mdash; you don’t qualify"
". I said I’m not filling this out anymore. You pay a fee to be told you don’t qu"
"alify doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.”</p><p>Since the FAFSA, the Free Applic"
"ation for Federal Student Aid, is free to submit, we suspect this man may have b"
"een interacting with a private company, or he may have fallen victim to one of t"
"he many scams that charge a fee to access (free) government benefits and service"
"s.</p><h4>Cost-benefit tradeoff</h4><p>Most people, before applying for governme"
"nt benefits or using a government service, assess the predicted return on their "
"investment. In most cases, they anticipate that the interaction will be frustrat"
"ing, and they want to have a sense of whether the benefit they receive will be w"
"orth the time and effort. &nbsp;People base these calculations on their past exp"
"eriences with the government and their level of confidence in navigating governm"
"ent bureaucracy.</p><p>Our interviewees reported frustration at filling out comp"
"lex forms, only to find out they weren’t eligible for the benefit or service in "
"question. Often, disqualifying factors &mdash; making too much money the previou"
"s year, for example &mdash;&nbsp;aren’t clearly communicated up front. When peop"
"le realize they’re ineligible only after filling out a long application, this la"
"ck of clear communication exacerbates their frustration.</p><p>We observed a str"
"ong relationship between people’s confidence that they’ll get the service they n"
"eed and their likelihood of applying for it. The less confident a person feels a"
"bout their prospect of getting a service, the less likely they are to apply.</p>"
"<p>In some cases, people feel so strongly that they won’t get a service that the"
"y won’t even consider applying. Aisha R., for example, feels she can’t adequatel"
"y prove her income to get a home loan &mdash; so she has stopped trying. “I’ve a"
"lready called the loan people and said this is how much I’ve made for the past c"
"ouple of years and ... [the loan officer is] like, ‘Nope.’ He already knows befo"
"re I submit it, so I don’t want to submit all of my paperwork and have them say,"
" ‘Oh, you’re denied.’ I don’t want to spin my wheels on that.”</p><p>Other peopl"
"e are more resilient and are willing to persevere until they achieve their goal."
" A few of our interviewees talked about appealing after being denied benefits; s"
"everal people we talked to mentioned applying multiple times for unemployment be"
"nefits. Danica R. had lost her job three times in the past, but described notabl"
"e resilience. She filed complaints for two of those three terminations, and went"
" to small claims court for the third. “I’m a fighter,” she said.</p><p>“[The pro"
"cess of applying for food stamps in California is] very redundant. It just felt "
"like I was filling out the same information over and over and over again. It wou"
"ld be easier if they just streamlined it. Put your answers in and whoever needs "
"it just takes the information from it.”</p><p><em>Next week's post will detail w"
