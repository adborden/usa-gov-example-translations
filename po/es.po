">.</em></p><h3>Trust</h3><h4>Trust is reciprocal</h4><p>Trust was a theme that f"
"igured into most of our conversations. Agencies tend to focus on building public"
" trust in government, but we found that the public views trust as a two-way stre"
"et: Not only does the public need to trust the government, but the government ne"
"eds to trust the public.</p><h4>Lack of reciprocal trust</h4><p>Many people feel"
" that government employees and agencies assume they have negative intentions or "
"that they&rsquo;re lying, lazy, or a criminal. One person reported feeling like "
"they were guilty until proven innocent.</p><p>Consider the experience of one of "
"our interviewees. Velma A., a resident of Jacksonville, applied for Social Secur"
"ity disability benefits twice. Her first application was denied, and so she appl"
"ied again. She expressed concern that her second application would also be denie"
"d &mdash;&nbsp;she admitted that she hadn&rsquo;t fully understood how to answer"
" all of the questions on the application, but she also felt she couldn&rsquo;t l"
"eave any fields blank. &ldquo;Leaving blanks is like you not really telling the "
"whole story,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so I filled it in best I could.&rdquo; She "
"knew her description of her disability wouldn&rsquo;t be as accurate as that wri"
"tten by a medical professional, and she worried the person reviewing her applica"
"tion would think she was lazy instead of legitimately disabled. The stress of wo"
"ndering how her application would be perceived compounded Velma&rsquo;s already "
"stressful situation.</p><p>How an agency physically represents itself also plays"
" a huge role in building trust. Jim F.,&nbsp;a senior citizen in Minneapolis, sa"
"id that visiting a local agency office \"feels like you're visiting someone in p"
"rison.\" He was put off by the security measures, including the metal detectors,"
" the glass pane between separating him from the government employee, and the met"
"al tray used to send documents back and forth.</p><p>These two stories illustrat"
"e the government&rsquo;s presumed lack of trust in the public. If the government"
" were to more explicitly communicate its assumption of the public's needs and po"
"sitive intent (and design services around both), it could drastically improve pu"
"blic perception.</p><h4>Deciding to trust government services</h4><p>Our intervi"
"ewees employed a variety of strategies before deciding to trust a government ser"
"vice.</p><p>Many people mentioned that they look for one or more of the followin"
"g to evaluate the trustworthiness of a digital service:</p><ul><li>https</li><li"
">.gov domains</li><li>Official government logos</li><li>Trust-building language "
"such as &ldquo;this is an official government website&rdquo;</li></ul><p>One of "
"our interviewees, for example, mentioned that he always looks for the .gov URL a"
"nd assumes a site is OK if he sees that. &ldquo;As far as I know,&rdquo; he said"
", \"government websites can't be spoofed yet.\"</p><p>Other people need more tha"
"n just the .gov to trust a site. Karen S. of Kansas City relies on several diffe"
"rent clues to assess a government site&rsquo;s trustworthiness. She told us that"
" she looks at the logos a site uses to determine its validity, and she also look"
"s for an affiliation to departments or agencies she&rsquo;s aware of. Finally, s"
"he said, she bases her trust on whether a site &ldquo;looks legit.&rdquo;</p><p>"
"Velma A. expressed a sentiment common to several of our interviewees. She feels "
"it&rsquo;s hard to rely on a fixed set of traits to determine a service&rsquo;s "
"trustworthiness. This uncertainty, she said, &ldquo; [is] why a lot of older peo"
"ple, like my parents are older, don&rsquo;t trust the internet for nothing.&rdqu"
"o;</p><p>People also look for certain trust signifiers in non-digital transactio"
"ns. Velma A. also mentioned that when she calls a government phone number, she s"
"pecifically listens for language like, &ldquo;Thank you for calling the U.S. dep"
"artment of&hellip;&rdquo;</p><h4>Government agencies versus private companies</h"
"4><p>Other folks aren&rsquo;t able to differentiate government services from pri"
"vate companies. A man in Minneapolis with three sons told a story about how he p"
"aid a fee to fill out the FAFSA for one of his sons. He said, &ldquo;You have to"
" take the FAFSA test so, I&rsquo;ll be a little critical, you pay money to be to"
"ld you don&rsquo;t qualify. Why don&rsquo;t they tell you right upfront. If your"
" income is above x, don&rsquo;t bother paying the fee just to be told you don&rs"
"quo;t qualify. I found that to be very frustrating and my wife, in the second ye"
"ar, says you need to do that again because you must not have filled it out right"
". I said I can&rsquo;t not fill it out right. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. So I fil"
"led it out again, paid the fee &mdash; you don&rsquo;t qualify. I said I&rsquo;m"
" not filling this out anymore. You pay a fee to be told you don&rsquo;t qualify "
"doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever.&rdquo;</p><p>Since the FAFSA, the Free "
"Application for Federal Student Aid, is free to submit, we suspect this man may "
"have been interacting with a private company, or he may have fallen victim to on"
"e of the many scams that charge a fee to access (free) government benefits and s"
"ervices.</p><h4>Cost-benefit tradeoff</h4><p>Most people, before applying for go"
"vernment benefits or using a government service, assess the predicted return on "
"their investment. In most cases, they anticipate that the interaction will be fr"
"ustrating, and they want to have a sense of whether the benefit they receive wil"
"l be worth the time and effort. &nbsp;People base these calculations on their pa"
"st experiences with the government and their level of confidence in navigating g"
"overnment bureaucracy.</p><p>Our interviewees reported frustration at filling ou"
"t complex forms, only to find out they weren&rsquo;t eligible for the benefit or"
" service in question. Often, disqualifying factors &mdash; making too much money"
" the previous year, for example &mdash;&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t clearly communicated u"
"p front. When people realize they&rsquo;re ineligible only after filling out a l"
"ong application, this lack of clear communication exacerbates their frustration."
"</p><p>We observed a strong relationship between people&rsquo;s confidence that "
"they&rsquo;ll get the service they need and their likelihood of applying for it."
" The less confident a person feels about their prospect of getting a service, th"
"e less likely they are to apply.</p><p>In some cases, people feel so strongly th"
"at they won&rsquo;t get a service that they won&rsquo;t even consider applying. "
"Aisha R., for example, feels she can&rsquo;t adequately prove her income to get "
"a home loan &mdash; so she has stopped trying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already called "
"the loan people and said this is how much I&rsquo;ve made for the past couple of"
" years and ... [the loan officer is] like, &lsquo;Nope.&rsquo; He already knows "
"before I submit it, so I don&rsquo;t want to submit all of my paperwork and have"
" them say, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re denied.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to spin my "
"wheels on that.&rdquo;</p><p>Other people are more resilient and are willing to "
"persevere until they achieve their goal. A few of our interviewees talked about "
"appealing after being denied benefits; several people we talked to mentioned app"
"lying multiple times for unemployment benefits. Danica R. had lost her job three"
" times in the past, but described notable resilience. She filed complaints for t"
"wo of those three terminations, and went to small claims court for the third. &l"
"dquo;I&rsquo;m a fighter,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;[The process of applying"
" for food stamps in California is] very redundant. It just felt like I was filli"
"ng out the same information over and over and over again. It would be easier if "
"they just streamlined it. Put your answers in and whoever needs it just takes th"

"that each student gets a hypothetical family situation which tells them how old "
"they are, whether or not they're married, whether or not they have kids, and wha"
"t kind of a job they have and what kind of an income they have.</p><p>John:<br /"

" that don't. All of the family situations have children, so we want them to see "
"how expensive that is.</p><p>John:<br />I had $1500 in childcare.</p><p>Jennifer"
