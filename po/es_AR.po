"<p>All government agencies have a common goal: to serve the public. As the front "
"door to government information and services, we help agencies achieve this goal. "
"We strive to make it easier for the public to find what they need by aggregating "
"and disseminating information about government programs and "
"services.</p><p>USAGov has an Outreach and Marketing team that helps agencies "
"amplify their key messages through a variety of channels. We’re most successful "
"when we partner with agencies to develop and promote initiatives that are "
"tailored to different audiences. In our partnerships, agency staff serve as the "
"subject matter experts who understand the content and trends in fields like "
"health care, benefits, and consumer protection. In turn, we provide a powerful "
"brand, marketing expertise, and an omni-channel platform.</p><p>Here are some "
"examples of how we’ve worked with agencies in the past to amplify information "
"about their programs and services:</p><ul><li>Smithsonian Science How Talks - We "
"receive information about Smithsonian Institute webinars and videos related to "
"elementary, middle, and high school curriculums up to two weeks in advance. We "
"then promote the events to our education subscribers in a <a "
"href=\"https://connect.usa.gov/smithsonian-fossils-winter-parks-ambassador-fellowship\">weekly "
"newsletter</a>. This has provided significant attendance numbers to "
"Smithsonian’s live events and contributed to a steady increase in email click "
"and open rates. This has also sustained our parent and teacher community after "
"we retired Kids.gov.</li><li>SSA Five Things to Know Before You Retire Facebook "
"Live - We worked with the Social Security Administration to <a "
"href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USAgov/videos/10155763418528580/\">produce and "
"manage a Facebook Live event in January 2018</a> to discuss retirement benefits. "
"Together, we developed talking points and promoted the event to influencers on "
"social media and the general public. We received nearly 300 questions and "
"reached over 270,000 people.</li><li>SBA Hispanic Entrepreneurs Google Hangout - "
"We helped the Small Business Administration <a "
"href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRYwxqE6Omg&amp;w=600\">host and moderate "
"a Google Hangout</a> to educate young entrepreneurs in Spanish. The 30-minute "
"event attracted 200 viewers and received more than 200 questions, generating "
"media coverage and 1,900 page views for SBA's online course.</li><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USAgov/videos/10154721182428580/\">FTC National "
"Consumer Protection Week and More</a>: In March 2017, USAGov partnered with the "
"Federal Trade Commission on a six-month bilingual public education campaign. We "
"created a joint editorial content calendar, which mapped out a timeline for "
"digital media strategies. As part of the strategy, we co-hosted multiple video "
"broadcasts, including a Facebook Live event for National Consumer Protection "
"Week that reached 24,000 people.</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in learning "

"<p>The <a "
"href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution\">Constitution of the "
"United States</a> divides the federal government into three branches to make "
"sure no individual or group will have too much "
"power:</p><ul><li>Legislative&mdash;Makes laws (Congress&mdash;House of "
"Representatives and Senate)</li><li>Executive&mdash;Carries out laws (President, "
"Vice President, Cabinet, most federal agencies)</li><li>Judicial&mdash;Evaluates "
"laws (Supreme Court and other courts)</li></ul><p>Each branch of government can "
"change acts of the other branches:</p><ul><li>The President can veto legislation "
"created by Congress and nominates heads of federal agencies.</li><li>Congress "
"confirms or rejects the President's nominees and can remove the President from "
"office in exceptional circumstances.</li><li>The Justices of the Supreme Court, "
"who can overturn unconstitutional laws, are nominated by the President and "
"confirmed by the Senate.</li></ul><p>This ability of each branch to respond to "
"the actions of the other branches is called the system of checks and "
"balances.</p><h3>Legislative Branch</h3><p>The legislative branch <a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/how-laws-are-made#item-35837\">drafts proposed "
"laws</a>, confirms or rejects Presidential nominations for heads of federal "
"agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court, and has the authority to "
"declare war. This branch includes Congress (the Senate and House of "
"Representatives) and <a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/legislative-agencies\">special agencies and "
"offices</a> that provide support services to Congress. American citizens have "
"the right to vote for Senators and Representatives through free, confidential "
"ballots.</p><ul><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\">Senate</a>&mdash;There "
"are two elected Senators per state, totaling 100 Senators. A Senate term is six "
"years and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can "
"serve.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.house.gov/representatives\">House of "
"Representatives</a>&mdash;There are 435 elected Representatives, which are "
"divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. There are "
"additional non-voting delegates who represent the District of Columbia and the "
"territories. A Representative serves a two-year term, and there is no limit to "
"the number of terms an individual can serve.</li></ul><h3>Executive "
"Branch</h3><p>The <a "
"href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-executive-branch/\">executive "
"branch</a>&nbsp;carries out and enforces laws. It includes the President, Vice "
"President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other "
"boards, commissions, and committees.</p><p>American citizens have the right to "
"vote for the President and Vice President through free, confidential "
"ballots.</p><p>Key roles of the executive branch include:</p><ul><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/donald-j-trump/\">President</a>&mdash;The "
"President leads the country. He or she is the head of state, leader of the "
"federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces. "
"The President serves a four-year term and can be elected no more than two "
"times.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/mike-pence/\">Vice "
"President</a>&mdash;The Vice President supports the President. If the President "
"is unable to serve, the Vice President becomes President. The Vice President can "
"be elected and serve an unlimited number of four-year terms as Vice President, "
"even under a different President.</li><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/the-cabinet/\">The "
"Cabinet</a>&mdash;Cabinet members serve as advisors to the President. They "
"include the Vice President, heads of executive departments, and other "
"high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the "
"President and must be approved by a simple majority of the Senate--51 votes if "
"all 100 Senators vote.</li></ul><h4>Executive Branch Agencies, Commissions, and "
"Committees</h4><p>Much of the work in the executive branch is done by federal "
"agencies, departments, committees, and other groups.</p><ul><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/executive-office-of-the-president\">Executive Office "
"of the President</a> &ndash; The Executive Office of the President communicates "
"the President’s message and deals with the federal budget, security, and other "
"high priorities.</li><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/executive-departments\">Executive Departments</a> "
"&ndash; These are the main agencies of the federal government. The heads of "
"these 15 agencies are also members of the President’s cabinet.<ul><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/sub-agencies\">Executive Department Sub-Agencies</a> "
"&ndash; Smaller sub-agencies support specialized work within their parent "
"executive department agencies.</li></ul></li><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/independent-agencies\">Independent Agencies</a> "
"&ndash; These agencies are not represented in the cabinet and are not part of "
"the Executive Office of the President. They deal with government operations, the "
"economy, and regulatory oversight.</li><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/boards-commissions-committees\">Boards, Commissions, "
"and Committees</a> &ndash; Congress or the President establish these smaller "
"organizations to manage specific tasks and areas that don’t fall under parent "
"agencies.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/quasi-official\">Quasi-Official "
"Agencies</a> &ndash; Although they’re not officially part of the executive "
"branch, these agencies are required by federal statute to release certain "
"information about their programs and activities in the <a "
"href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/\">Federal Register, the daily journal of "
"government activities</a>.</li></ul><h3>Judicial Branch</h3><p>The <a "
"href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-judicial-branch/\">judicial "
"branch</a>&nbsp;interprets the meaning of laws, applies laws to individual "
"cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution. It's comprised of the "
"Supreme Court and other federal courts.</p><ul><li><a "
"href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/\">Supreme Court</a>&mdash;The Supreme Court "
"is the highest court in the United States. The Justices of the Supreme Court are "
"nominated by the President and must be approved by the Senate.<ul><li><a "
"href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx\">Nine members</a> make "
"up the Supreme Court&mdash; a Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices. There "
"must be a minimum or quorum of <a "
"href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/faq_general.aspx\">six Justices</a> to "
"decide a case.</li><li>If there is an even number of Justices and a case results "
"in a tie, the lower court's decision stands.</li><li>There is no fixed term for "
"Justices. They serve until their death, retirement, or removal in exceptional "
"circumstances.</li><li>Learn more about <a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/supreme-court\">how the supreme court "
"works</a>.</li></ul></li><li><p><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/judicial-agencies\">Federal Courts and Judicial "
"Agencies</a> &ndash; The Constitution gives Congress the authority to establish "
"other <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts\">federal "
"courts</a> to handle cases that involve federal laws including tax and "
"bankruptcy, lawsuits involving U.S. and state governments or the Constitution, "
"and more. Other federal judicial agencies and programs support the courts and "
"research judicial policy.</p></li></ul><h4>Confirmation Process for Judges and "
"Justices</h4><p>Appointments for Supreme Court Justices and other federal "
"judgeships follow the same basic process:</p><ul><li>The President nominates a "
"person to fill a vacant judgeship.</li><li>The <a "
"href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/nominations\">Senate Judiciary "
"Committee</a> holds a hearing on the nominee and votes on whether to forward the "
"nomination to the full Senate.</li><li>If the nomination moves forward, the "
"Senate can debate the nomination. Debate must end before the Senate can vote on "
"whether to confirm the nominee. A Senator will request unanimous consent to end "
"the debate, but any Senator can refuse.</li><li>Without unanimous consent, the "
"Senate must pass a <a "
"href=\"https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Cloture_vrd.htm\">cloture "
"motion</a> to end the debate. It takes a simple majority of votes&mdash;51 if "
"all 100 Senators vote&mdash;to pass cloture and end debate about a federal "
"judicial nominee.</li><li>Once the debate ends, the Senate votes on "
"confirmation. The nominee for Supreme Court or any other federal judgeship needs "
"a simple majority of votes&mdash;51 if all 100 Senators vote&mdash;to be "
"confirmed.</li></ul>"

"<p>The answer may surprise you. It takes time, resources and actual money. Why "
"prepare a video for something that can be written about and released in a "
"shorter time&nbsp;span at a much lower cost? This question is now the new "
"normal. But are we asking the right question?</p><p>According to a <a "
"href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/digital-es-universal-how-us-hispanics-are-driving-growth-in-digital.html\">Nielsen&nbsp;report</a>, "
"the average Hispanic spends more than eight hours viewing online videos every "
"month. That is 1.5 hours more than the U.S. average. Despite having a smaller "
"audience, the engagement on Spanish videos is greater than that of its "
"counterparts. Spanish video content simply seems to “stick” better.</p><p>This "
"is something we’ve seen firsthand at USA.gov. Across all social media, "
"GobiernoUSA.gov’s audience is smaller than that of its sister site USA.gov. The "
"English channels are larger on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Yet, when it comes "
"to video viewership,&nbsp;<a "
"href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GobiernoUSA\">GobiernoUSA.gov’s YouTube "
"channel</a>&nbsp;is much higher despite having less subscribers.</p><p>In fact "
"from August 2014 to August 2015, <a "
"href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/USGovernment\">USA.gov’s YouTube "
"channel&nbsp;</a>has gotten over 45,000 views with an estimated 59,000 minutes "
"watched. On the other hand, GobiernoUSA.gov’s YouTube channel received more than "
"221,000 views with over 375,000 minutes watched during the same period. Even "
"though GobiernoUSA.gov published one new video and streamed one event compared "
"to USA.gov’s five videos and two streamed events, the content in Spanish went "
"much farther. The hungry audience for Spanish-language video material can't be "
"ignored.</p><p>We can see it in the corporate world, as more and more retailers "
"are creating Spanish video content that goes beyond a 30-second ad during a "
"commercial break. YouTube channels play a bigger role than ever, as viewership "
"moves from the TV to the computer. The next years could show a shift to video "
"content as creators realize that this could be the key for the Spanish markets. "
"We could be on the verge of seeing a shift to:</p><ul><li>Vertical video "
"content&mdash;if everyone watches videos on their phones or tablets, why "
"not?</li><li>Integrated messages on a single platform&mdash;get everything by "
"clicking on a video.</li><li>Cross-brand Hispanic targeted campaigns, with some "
"serious punditry. (ie. phone and insurance companies)</li></ul><h3>A Final "
"Thought</h3><p>In most cases, the content in English is the bread and butter of "
"a platform and Spanish takes a second seat since it serves a smaller audience. "
"But statistics show that even if the raw numbers are lower, Hispanics place more "
"importance and time on video resources, giving content in Spanish a higher "
"penetration rate. This is not to discourage English video content, but encourage "
"you to give serious thought to incorporating video content in Spanish related to "
"your mission. Even Netflix has rolled out two productions for Spanish audiences "
"this year. The trend suggests we could be headed to the&nbsp;golden age of video "
"content in Spanish, and we cannot afford to be caught off "
"guard.</p><p><em>Edgardo Morales is a member of the USAGov&nbsp;Marketing and "

"Use&nbsp;as few words as possible, but enough so people can easily understand "
"your message the first time through.</li><li>Use action verbs when possible. "
"Examples:<ul><li><strong>Contact </strong>your elected "

"15.</li><li><strong>Find</strong> more information about traveling&nbsp;with "
"children.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Be inclusive, and avoid jargon only certain "
"audiences would understand, unless you are writing only for them.</li><li>Use "
"acronyms only when they're meaningful to the reader. More people recognize "
"\"FBI\" than the \"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" for "
"example.</li><li>Organize text in small sections separated by "
"sub-headers.</li><li>Use bulleted or numbered lists to organize "
"information.</li><li><strong>Spanish:</strong>&nbsp;Avoid using historical "
"present (<em>presente&nbsp;histórico</em>) verb tense. It may be confusing to "

"<p><a "
"href=\"https://blog.usa.gov/usa-gov-launches-vote-usa-gov-to-help-citizens-register-to-vote\">One "
"year ago this week</a>, we launched <a href=\"https://vote.gov/\">vote.gov</a> "
"(also known as vote.usa.gov). It’s a concise and simple site with a single "
"mission: direct citizens through the voter registration process as quickly as "
"possible. It was created by a joint team of <a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/\">USA.gov</a> staffers and <a "
"href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows\">Presidential Innovation "
"Fellows</a>, all of whom work within the <a "
"href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/\">General Services Administration</a>.</p><p>Did it "
"work? Yes. In fact, it worked so well that Facebook made it the destination for "
"their 2016 voter registration drive. Last Friday, it received over five million "
"user visits, among the highest count ever recorded by a U.S. government website "
"in a single day.</p><p>It was a good site, but there was room for improvement. "
"The site was only available in English.The pages for individual states did not "
"have URLs, so it was hard to share them with other people. We weren’t sure if "
"the front page really needed to be that long.</p><p>So, earlier this year, "
"USA.gov worked together with <a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/\">18F</a> to "
"research, prototype, test, and implement an improved version of "
"vote.gov.</p><p>Today, on National Voter Registration Day, we’re launching this "
"new version.</p><p>The changes are small, but significant:</p><ul><li><p>The "
"whole site is now <a href=\"https://vote.gov/es/\">available in "
"Spanish</a>.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to usability testing and analytics, we "
"realised we could remove much of the front page content. The site entrance is "
"now considerably leaner and faster: the total data that a user has to download "
"is less than one-third of the previous amount.</p></li><li><p>The visual design "
"has been updated, and is now based on another USAGov &amp; 18F collaboration: "
"the <a href=\"https://standards.usa.gov/\">US Web Design "
"Standards</a>.</p></li><li><p>The site is fully functional without "
"Javascript.</p></li><li><p>All parts of the site are reachable via URLs, which "
"allows people to share individual state pages directly in &nbsp;either English "
"or Spanish.</p></li></ul><p>The largest change will be totally invisible to most "
"users: we’ve switched from a bespoke single HTML page to a multi-page site "
"deployed on 18F’s <a href=\"https://cloud.gov/\">cloud.gov</a> application "
"platform. This gives our development process more flexibility, and made the "
"above improvements much easier to implement. If this is the aspect that most "
"interests you, feel free to take a look at the <a "
"href=\"https://github.com/18F/vote-gov/\">source code</a>. As always with our "
"open source projects: code contributions are welcome!</p><p>Finally, please "
"share the site. Voting is a great privilege of citizenship. We want everyone who "
"can to register to vote.</p><p><em>Yoz Grahame is a software developer at 18F, "

"<p>Anyone engaged in content marketing or content production probably owns a "
"robust editorial calendar. &nbsp;A calendar that is quickly updated, helps keep "
"deadlines and is flexible can serve as a helpful blueprint of your content "
"activities for the year.</p><p>At USAGov we cover a lot of topics and partner "
"with many agencies. Having an editorial calendar has helped us in a variety of "
"ways, from staying on top of deadlines and deliverables, to giving us the space "
"to focus on the topics that resonate best with our audiences.</p><h3>How We "
"Populate Our Calendar</h3><p>The USAGov team has a lot of ideas and many "
"partners to work with. Across our group we have content managers who follow "
"specific topics and build partnerships among specific initiatives and contact "
"center points of contacts who routinely share frequently asked questions. Anyone "
"can submit a campaign idea through our Google Form, which asks the "
"following:</p><ol><li><p>What is your idea?</p></li><li><p>When will this "
"promotion take place?</p></li><li><p>Who is the target "
"audience?</p></li><li><p>What language is this promotion in? English? Spanish? "
"Both?</p></li><li><p>What website(s) will this promotion "
"impact?</p></li><li><p>What support will be needed?</p><ol><li><p>Social "
"media</p></li><li><p>Email</p></li><li><p>Syndication wire</p></li><li><p>Media "
"outreach</p></li><li><p>Partner outreach</p></li><li><p>Graphics/multimedia "
"support</p></li><li><p>Technical support</p></li><li><p>Metrics "
"support</p></li><li><p>Other</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Who is submitting this "
"idea?</p></li><li><p>Any other info we should know about this idea? (Helpful "
"links, commitments to agencies, etc)</p></li></ol><h3>How Ideas Turn Into "
"Campaigns</h3><p>These ideas populate a spreadsheet which the marketing team "
"routinely looks at and discusses. We try not to have more than two or three "
"large campaigns a month, though we do leave room for emerging topics or requests "
"from partners or other stakeholders.</p><p>Editorial calendars are a great way "
"to keep the team focused and organized. They also serve as great reminders of "
"activities taking place, and keep everyone apprised of projects each month. Our "
"editorial calendar also helps connect national observances and natural ties to "
"other agencies' content dissemination efforts.</p><h3>How We Manage a Swelling "
"Calendar</h3><p>Editorial calendars can have as little or as much detail as you "
"think you need. But generally, it is much more manageable to include fewer "
"details and to avoid having information that's out of date, especially in "
"fast-paced environment where aspects of campaigns are being tweaked or have many "
"moving pieces. &nbsp;This is more aimed at a bird's eye view of what's coming, "
"and what we've done. It isn't designed to be a project workflow. While our "
"editorial calendar updates are a bit of a manual process, we've realized that "
"sometimes keeping things simple really is better. Anyone can update it, and "
"anyone can include comments, questions, and other details.</p><p><em>Victoria "

"Office (GPO) facility in Pueblo, Colorado. The decision was difficult, but "

"it in 1970 to help federal agencies share consumer information with the "
"public.</p><p>A year later, we began publishing the <strong>Consumer Information "
"Catalog</strong> to promote and distribute agencies’ consumer publications. We "
"needed a dedicated distribution facility to store and send out those "
"publications. And Pueblo’s Congressman Frank E. Evans was instrumental in "
"creating legislation to place the distribution facility within his city and "
"bring us on as its customer. At one time, one in four Americans surveyed knew "
"the name \"Pueblo\" was related to government publications, thanks to our public "
"service announcements on TV and radio.</p><p>From helping folks buy "
"refrigerators to picking an investment adviser, the USAGov program, known over "
"the years as the Consumer Information Center and the Federal Citizen Information "
"Center, has been the U.S. government’s face for trusted consumer Information. "
"Local and national news outlets, especially the weekly magazine, "
"<strong>Parade</strong>, regularly mentioned our publications, and columnist "
"Dear Abby promoted packets of publications on timely topics with great response "
"from her 110 million readers.</p><p>Through the years, we distributed 1.27 "
"billion publications and <strong>Catalogs</strong> at a low cost to the more "
"than 200 federal agencies and programs that participated, and mostly free to our "
"customers. By far the most popular publication has been and still is USAGov’s "
