"amplify their key messages through a variety of channels. We’re most successful "
"when we partner with agencies to develop and promote initiatives that are "
"tailored to different audiences. In our partnerships, agency staff serve as the "
"subject matter experts who understand the content and trends in fields like "
"health care, benefits, and consumer protection. In turn, we provide a powerful "
"brand, marketing expertise, and an omni-channel platform.</p><p>Here are some "
"examples of how we’ve worked with agencies in the past to amplify information "
"about their programs and services:</p><ul><li>Smithsonian Science How Talks - We "
"receive information about Smithsonian Institute webinars and videos related to "
"elementary, middle, and high school curriculums up to two weeks in advance. We "
"then promote the events to our education subscribers in a <a "
"href=\"https://connect.usa.gov/smithsonian-fossils-winter-parks-ambassador-fellowship\">weekly "
"newsletter</a>. This has provided significant attendance numbers to "
"Smithsonian’s live events and contributed to a steady increase in email click "

"href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USAgov/videos/10155763418528580/\">produce and "
"manage a Facebook Live event in January 2018</a> to discuss retirement benefits. "
"Together, we developed talking points and promoted the event to influencers on "
"social media and the general public. We received nearly 300 questions and "
"reached over 270,000 people.</li><li>SBA Hispanic Entrepreneurs Google Hangout - "
"We helped the Small Business Administration host and moderate a Google Hangout "
"to educate young entrepreneurs in Spanish. The 30-minute event attracted 200 "
"viewers and received more than 200 questions, generating media coverage and "
"1,900 page views for SBA's online course.</li><li><a "

msgid ""
"<p><em>USA.gov’s Analytics Success: using analytics data to inform design and "
"responsivity to create a better experience for the user</em></p><p>Last year, "
"the USA.gov team found themselves facing a challenge. We were in need of a new "
"content management system for our websites, <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/\" "
"style=\"text-decoration:none;\">USA.gov</a> and <a "
"href=\"https://gobierno.usa.gov/\" "
"style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Gobierno.USA.gov</a>, which help people find and "
"understand the most frequently requested government information. We wanted to "
"align the content on those websites with content in the knowledge base used by "
"our contact center; up until this point, the information in those two places had "
"been similar but unique. In addition, we thought this was an opportunity for a "
"design refresh.</p><p>That’s a whole lot of “new.” &nbsp;Where to "
"begin?</p><p>We decided to start with the data! &nbsp;A lot of that data was "
"from the Digital Analytics Program’s (DAP) Google Analytics (GA) account -- "
"mainly, how were people using our current versions of the site?</p><p>Some of us "
"set out to create a new knowledge base that would fill our future version of the "
"site and our contact center’s customer resource management tool with wonderful "
"content. We looked at usage of the existing content in our contact center and on "
"the web in order to isolate the most needed content. For web content, we used "
"GA, in particular, <a "
"href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en\" "
"style=\"text-decoration:none;\">unique pageviews </a>for an entire year. Some of "
"our content is seasonal, so it helps to look at a year at once. Using unique "
"pageviews helped us line up a little bit better with our data sources like "
"content used by our contact center agents.</p><p>The GA data helped us know what "
"was most popular in obvious ways, and therefore what to keep and what not to "
"keep. However, it also influenced our understanding of our users’ needs in a way "
"that influenced our design. <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/\">USA.gov</a><a "
"href=\"https://www.usa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">&nbsp;</a>and <a "
"href=\"https://gobierno.usa.gov/\">GobiernoUSA.gov</a> have a handful of "
"standout popular content, but even the standout content really just adds up to a "
"small portion of the overall site usage. That helped us understand that we "
"wouldn’t be focusing prominently on any dominant tasks.</p><p>To better "
"understand user behavior, we wanted to know how people got to our sites, where "
"people started their visits, what they did when they got there, and how long "
"they stayed. Google Analytics was helpful on all counts. Most users came from "
"search engines, and they primarily did not land on our home page. &nbsp;Rather, "
"they started their experience with us on a content page somewhere within our "
"site, and for them, that was in effect our home page. This influenced our design "
"by telling us that users would be orienting themselves on pages that we normally "
"wouldn’t consider as a place to come to understand what our website is about. "
"This was one of our data sources that convinced us to really pare down the "
"design to just the essentials: one primary place for content, navigation, and "
"search.</p><p>GA told us that our visitors did not hang out with us for very "
"long. After jumping into the middle of our site from a search engine, they most "
"often read the content on that one page and then used one of our links to pursue "
"what they were trying to do. This was despite having a design that had columns "
"of little boxes about other things that people might be interested in; so GA was "
"one of the data sources that convinced us to strip that out. &nbsp;For those "
"visitors that did stay with us for more than one page, there was a big drop off "
"after two or three pages. That led us towards a controversial decision: the "
"parent pages that would feature links to the section “beneath” them would not "
"share the navigation choices on the left side that the content pages would have. "
"We simply lacked the data to point to that supported people wanting to navigate "
"up and up, step-by-step. Now that we have time, we are actually implementing a "
"new navigation on parent pages, and we’ll be interested to see the "
"impact.</p><p>Google Analytics also helped us understand that mobile users were "
"becoming an increasing percentage of our customers. This contributed to our "
"desire to make sure that our design was equally direct for users on mobile and "
"desktop, and therefore to allow our writers not to think about different "
"platforms when writing. The result was one column of content on every type of "
"device. If an idea wasn’t important enough to be included in the main content, "
"then it didn’t need to be in a desktop-only bonus box on the "
"side.</p><p>Overall, Google Analytics usage data helped us pare down a sprawling "
"site with busy content pages in a more efficient site that catered to its true "
"primary users: people jumping in from Google to get an overview of a topic and "
"know where to go next, and perhaps check out very closely related information as "
"well. It’s also been hugely influential on our home page designs, as we strive "
"to create a home page that enables the types of uses for our site that are most "
"prevalent. But that’s a blog post for another day!</p><p><em>David Kaufmann is a "
